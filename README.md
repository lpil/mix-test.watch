Automatically run your Elixir project's tests each time you save a file.
Because TDD is awesome.


## Usage

Add it to your dependencies:

```elixir
# mix.exs (Elixir 1.4)
def deps do
  [{:mix_test_watch, "~> 0.3", only: :dev, runtime: false}]  
end
```

```elixir
# mix.exs (Elixir 1.3 and earlier)
def deps do
  [{:mix_test_watch, "~> 0.3", only: :dev}]
end
```

Run the mix task

```
mix test.watch
```

Start hacking :)


## Running Additional Mix Tasks

Through the mix config it is possible to run other mix tasks as well as the
test task. For example, if I wished to run the [Dogma][dogma] code style
linter after my tests I would do so like this.

[dogma]: https://github.com/lpil/dogma

```elixir
# config/config.exs
use Mix.Config

if Mix.env == :dev do
  config :mix_test_watch,
    tasks: [
      "test",
      "dogma",
    ]
end
```

Tasks are run in the order they appear in the list, and the progression will
stop if any command returns a non-zero exit code.

All tasks are run with `MIX_ENV` set to `test`.


## Passing Arguments To Tasks

Any command line arguments passed to the `test.watch` task will be passed
through to the tasks being run. If I only want to run the tests from one file
every time I save a file I could do so with this command:

```
mix test.watch test/file/to_test.exs
```

Note that if you have configured more than one task to be run these arguments
will be passed to all the tasks run, not just the test command.


## Clearing The Console Before Each Run

If you want mix test.watch to clear the console before each run, you can
enable this option in your config/dev.exs as follows:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
use Mix.Config

if Mix.env == :dev do
  config :mix_test_watch,
    clear: true
end
```

## Excluding files or directories

To ignore changes from specific files or directories just add `exclude:` regexp
patterns to your config in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
use Mix.Config

if Mix.env == :dev do
  config :mix_test_watch,
    exclude: [~r/db_migration\/.*/,
              ~r/useless_.*\.exs/]
end
```

## Compatibility Notes

On Linux you may need to install `inotify-tools`.

## Desktop Notifications

You can enable desktop notifications with
[ex_unit_notifier](https://github.com/navinpeiris/ex_unit_notifier).
